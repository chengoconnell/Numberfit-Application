# Numberfit-Application
A better way to teach multiplication.

Proposed Project Description:
The app must support the following basic requirements:
• Provide a way for children to learn times tables 1-12.
• Provide a way for children to practise times tables.Students should master times tables 1-12.
• The app should be designed to be visually appealing to the target audience of young schoolchildren, e.g. through bright colours, sound effects, animations etc.
• The application must show scores and times and also show progression.
• It should also have a teacher login which shows how everyone in their class has done. The teacher login should also link to each student’s parent login, so that a teacher can inform them of their child’s progress in class, perhaps stemming from using the app at home to practice.
  
Below is a list of features the app could support. This list is not exhaustive.
• Different exercise types so students can learn more difficult times tables (e.g. 18 times table). Students may use their imagination to achieve this.
• A way for a student to compete against, say, two of their friends in real-time in different games for practising times tables.
• It would be a bonus if any learning or practice games incorporated physical activities (e.g. answer a question, do five star jumps).
• Ability to extend to say include addition and subtraction assessment.
